Hi there, this is my re-creation of one of my favorite websites! 
It's the home site for one of the video games that I love to play at the moment, 'Marvel Rivals', 
and it's all constructed with HTML, CSS, Boostrap, and some Javascript! 

Some of the main highlights of this webpage include: 
 - Responsive Design for multiple screen sizes and types
 - Well structured design with comments, making it easier to read and understand 
 - A Navigation bar with multiple links to different pages and a responsive Bootstrap design to accomodate to multiple screen sizes 
 - A fluid design and feel throughout the whole page 
 - A Form section that asks for user sign in, and a link to create an account if the user doesn't already have one 
 - Multiple Cards highlighting upcoming events in the game's community
 - A Table and Carousel showcasing characters, abilities, and team-ups featured in the game 
 - A Modal Pop-up that appears when a user clicks the centered button labeled "Play Now" 
 - Javascript functions for some small features, meant to be included later on 

This website demonstrates efficent and responsive webiste design using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Javascript. 
There is still so much more to learn but I hope this site can demonstrate what I've learned so far!!
Thank you!
